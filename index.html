					<h2>About Us</h2>
					
						
<p>The Olympians Association of India (OAI) is a registered non-profit organisation comprised of Indian Olympians, past and present, desirous of serving their community and their country.</p>

<p>The knowledge accumulated by Olympians through their illustrious careers and the wealth of experience gained through competing at the highest levels of international sport is a great resource for our country.</p>

<p>The OAI seeks to utilise this resource for the continued development and improvement of our country’s sport in close collaboration with the government and sports administration bodies. By setting up expert panels of eminent Olympians to assist the government and sports administration, OAI aims for a greater involvement of Olympians in nurturing the future generation of athletes.</p>

<p>The OAI also serve as a support system for the community of Olympians running various programs for the benefit of Olympians who are no longer actively competing.  Activities such as education programs, placement in corporate jobs, application for pension and other schemes will be carried in addition to sports workshops. The World Olympians Association is the parent body of the OAI and is headquartered in Lausanne. It was co founded by IOC president J.A Samaranch.  The WOA is integrated with the IOC and its members are part of the IOC Athletes commission.

				<h2>Programs</h2>
			<h3>Outreach Programs</h3>
			<p>India has produced about 895 Olympians since India’s participation at the first Olympiad. However, except for a few prominent figures not much is known about the vast majority of Indian Olympians who have represented our country at the highest level of international sport. How many Indian Olympians are alive today? Do all Indian Olympians have access to decent living conditions? </p>
			<p>
			The outreach program aims to account for all Indian Olympians. Through our network of Sponsors, Government Agencies and Alumni network, we aim to improve the lives of our country’s heroes. 
			We wish to reach out to them and recognize their contribution in making the country proud.</p>

			<p>Coming close to sending the largest Indian contingent for the 2016 Rio Olympics it is about time we play a role in ensuring the contribution and recognition due is given. 
			This in turn will form the largest and strongest foundation for the flourishing Sports Industry and giving rise to enriched expertise to drive us to greater heights.</p>
			
			<h3>Mentorship Programs</h3>
			<p>
				Having played an important role in contributing and reaching the highest level of International Sport it is also our duty to ensure we look into the future of sport. With the mentorship programs we aim to encourage and support future talented athletes; with a liaison academies be able to augment the career of the future of sports.
			</p>
			<h3>Medical Insurance</h3>
			<p>
				
					Every recognized sector of our society as a means of recognition to their contribution is given a pension or medical benefits to help them at their need of hour; similarly it is only fair we can focus on giving out similar assistance to our Olympian community and bring forth health, enriched expertise and appreciation on a recognized platform to celebrate with the society ahead.
